# Project Starfish 

A  cross platform client side application that would let you open a file in IDE of your choice (vscode, eclipse, intellij, emacs, vi, etc.) and  other cammands locally directly from the browser or file system.This will enable an option to “Open in IDE” through browser extension on various websites like github, gitlab,gitbucket etc similar to one you see in this demo below.

## Workflow
- Click on "Open in IDE" on Repository page.
- Repository is cloned
- The cloned Repository is opened in the preferred IDE.

## Necessary Utilities 
- A browser extension that injects "Open In IDE" button 
- Custom URI Handler to handle `ide://` scheme.
- A native application that clones the repository and opens up the IDE.
- A configuration file (.yaml) to hold the Preferred IDE and Clone Path.
- Command line support for application.

## Targeted Websites:
- Primary: [github.com](https://github.com/)
- Secondary: [gitlab.com](https://gitlab.com/)
- Additional: [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/)
..more can be added

## Targeted Platforms:
- Linux
- Windows
- Mac OS X

## Quick Command reference:
- Starting in Development mode : `mvn quarkus:dev`
- Passing arguements: When you run with `mvn quarkus:dev` you can add `-Dquarkus.args=yourvalue` as arguments you want to pass into the command line.
  Example `mvn quarkus:dev -Dquarkus.args="https://github.com/user/repo.git"`
- Building native executable: `mvnw package -Dnative`

## Contributing to Starfish
- Issues: Start by looking at the existing issues at https://github.com/maxandersen/starfish/issues[starfish/issues] and create a Pull Request with appropriate description/comment.
- Bugs: Run the starfish application and if you find unexpected behaviour then open a new issue with label `bug` and include a proper description/comment.
- Feature request: Brainstorm ideas and bring them to surface on the features that can be implemented in starfish and then create an issue with label as `enahancement`.Always include as exhaustive description as possible to help understand better.
